Speech Therapy is an Amazon Alexa skill meant for users who would like to improve their speaking skills.

The user is asked to repeat phrases back to Alexa, which she then analyzes for errors such as stuttering, false starts, or mispronunciation. Speech Therapy then focuses on these problem areas, and continually drills the user on them.

In this way, a user can rapidly improve the clarity of their speech patterns.

The user may say "skip" at any time, to skip to the next phrase.
The user may say "help" at any time, to receive instructions from Alexa.
The user may also say "quit" or "cancel" to stop using Speech Therapy.
 
Speech Therapy provides practice for saying difficult words and phrases, utilizing instant feedback & focused learning to improve your speaking skills.
